## Diabetes Prediction Model

This is a simple logistic regression model that can be used to predict whether a person has diabetes. The model is trained on a dataset of 768 people, and it achieves an accuracy of 78%.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. First, we import the necessary libraries.

```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import linear_model
```

2. Next, we load the diabetes dataset.

```
df = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')
```

3. We then split the data into training and testing sets.

```
x = df.drop('Outcome', axis = 1)
y = df.Outcome
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size = 0.2)
```

4. We then create a logistic regression model and fit it to the training data.

```
model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

5. Finally, we use the model to predict the outcome for the test data.

```
out = model.predict(x_test)
```

### Conclusion

This is a simple example of how to use logistic regression to predict a binary outcome. This model could be used to help doctors diagnose diabetes, or it could be used to help people assess their risk of developing diabetes.
